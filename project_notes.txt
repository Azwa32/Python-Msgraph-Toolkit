id like to build this into a portfolio project to demonstrate my experience with the msgraph api. as you can see its a tool to be used as part of a wider program and i'd like to keep it like that, that way myself for others can drop it into a project. what are some ideas that would make it A, a more usefull drop in tool and B, more impressive to a recruiter/company. I dont want to veer away from it being a drop in tool, so anything that makes it more useful in that respect would be good

1. Create the directory structure first

2. exceptions.py - Start here for context
Define all your custom exceptions
You'll immediately understand what can go wrong
Sets the error handling patterns for everything else

3. config.py - Configuration foundation
Build this while thinking about your current hardcoded values
You'll see exactly what needs to be configurable
Uses exceptions.py for validation
Phase 2: Utilities (Day 3)

4. utils/init.py - Package setup

5. utils/retry.py - Critical for API reliability
You'll immediately see where retry logic is needed
Think about your current API calls and their failure modes

6. utils/pagination.py - Handle large datasets
Build this while looking at your exceed_drive_query() method
You'll understand the pagination patterns
Phase 3: Models - Start with your biggest/most complex (Day 4-5)

7. models/init.py - Package setup

8. models/sharepoint.py - Start here (most of your code)
Move your SharePoint methods here
You'll see patterns for error handling, retry, pagination
This is your largest section - tackle it first while you have energy
Establishes the pattern for other models

9. models/outlook.py - Email operations
Smaller, follows the pattern from SharePoint
You'll see how the structure scales

10. models/users.py - User management
Smallest model, quick win
Completes the models layer
Phase 4: Main Interface (Day 6)

11. client.py - This is where everything clicks
Orchestrates all the models
You'll see the clean interface emerge
Import and use all your models
This is your "aha!" moment

12. init.py - Package interface
Define what users import
You'll understand the public API
Phase 5: Usage & Validation (Day 7)

13. examples/basic_usage.py - Critical for understanding
Write this immediately after client.py
You'll see if your API is actually easy to use
Catch design issues early

14. examples/advanced_usage.py - Advanced patterns
Show complex scenarios
Validate your design decisions

15. tests/test_sharepoint.py - Test your biggest component
Start with your most complex functionality
You'll understand what needs mocking

16. tests/test_client.py - Integration tests

17. tests/init.py - Test package setup
