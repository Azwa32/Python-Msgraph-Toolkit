reason for project

requirements for project 

structure of project, seperates major concerns auth, pagination, retry logic, services

desicions around how the api call would be made, 

Requiremets:
must be descriptive, 
easy to call,
never excessive,
no more arguments than required,
only one drive per instance

Coming up with the structure of the calls as this is the inteface for the project

the approach used is dependancy injection
the benefits are: 
-All services use the same authentication context
-No duplicate credential management
-Consistent token handling across services

initialise the main client first, allowing authentication.
during this process the child services initialise with the graph_clint passed into them
