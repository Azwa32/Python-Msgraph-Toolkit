reason for project

requirements for project 

structure of project, seperates major concerns auth, pagination, retry logic, services

desicions around how the api call would be made, 

Requiremets:
must be descriptive, 
easy to call,
never excessive,
no more arguments than required,
multiple sites per instance
copying between site drives possible
runs in application mode not personal mode
error handling so incorrect args cannot crash program
OAuth

Pre-Requesites
Setup Azure web app with correct API permissions
Azure>Entra ID>App Registrations>Your App>API Permissions>Add a permission>Microsoft Graph>Application Permissions(as opposed to delegate) 
API Error code 403 means insufficient permissions


Coming up with the structure of the calls as this is the inteface for the project

the approach used is "Service layer pattern" with "heiarachical service organization"
the benefits are: 
-All services use the same authentication context
-No duplicate credential management
-Consistent token handling across services

initialise the main client first, allowing authentication.
during this process the child services initialise with the graph_clint passed into them

Sharepoint
allowing folder path or folder id via / or \ detection, coupled with a sprinkling of error handling

adding verbose tooltips

Adding error handling & exceptions
