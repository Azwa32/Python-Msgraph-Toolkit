reason for project

requirements for project 

structure of project, seperates major concerns auth, pagination, retry logic, services

desicions around how the api call would be made, 

Requiremets:
must be descriptive, 
easy to call,
never excessive,
no more arguments than required,
multiple sites per instance
copying between site drives possible
runs in application mode not personal mode
error handling so incorrect args cannot crash program
OAuth

Pre-Requesites
Setup Azure web app with correct API permissions
Azure>Entra ID>App Registrations>Your App>API Permissions>Add a permission>Microsoft Graph>Application Permissions(as opposed to delegate) 
API Error code 403 means insufficient permissions

used msgraph python sdk instead of http calls, SDKs handle authentication, serialization, error handling automatically,The SDK handles OAuth2, token refresh, app registrations correctly
"I chose the Microsoft Graph SDK because it handles authentication 
token refresh, provides type safety, and reduces boilerplate. 
However, I still needed to create a service layer abstraction 
because the SDK is quite verbose for common operations."

## Error Handling Strategy

Implemented custom exception hierarchy on top of Microsoft Graph SDK because:

1. **SDK provides generic HTTP errors** - not business-contextual
2. **Custom exceptions provide meaningful context** for client applications
3. **Consistent error interface** across all services (SharePoint, Outlook, Teams)
4. **Better developer experience** - specific exception types for specific error handling

Pattern: Catch SDK exceptions → Transform to business exceptions → Preserve original context

This follows industry patterns used by AWS SDK, Stripe SDK, and other enterprise libraries.

Coming up with the structure of the calls as this is the inteface for the project

the approach used is "Service layer pattern" with "heiarachical service organization"
the benefits are: 
-All services use the same authentication context
-No duplicate credential management
-Consistent token handling across services

initialise the main client first, allowing authentication.
during this process the child services initialise with the graph_clint passed into them

Sharepoint
allowing folder path or folder id via / or \ detection, coupled with a sprinkling of error handling

adding verbose tooltips

Adding error handling & exceptions
wanted no tracebacks for incorrect method args for best user experience
encountered an issue where exceptions were in place but tracebacks were still occouring. 
The traceback shows the exception is being raised in the SDK's HTTP layer:
"File "kiota_http/httpx_request_adapter.py", line 573, in throw_failed_responses"
This suggests the SDK is configured to throw exceptions immediately, bypassing your exception handling.

May add logger for errors?

# graph api has built in error handling for incorrect credentials


### For Outlook services need folowing permissions in Azure
Calendars.Read - Read calendars in all mailboxes
Calendars.ReadWrite - Read and write calendars in all mailboxes
Calendars.Read.Shared - Read shared calendars
Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared - Read and write shared calendars

deciding between a simple method for sending emails or one single all in one
ended up going with teh all in one method, all options, one function, detailed tooltip
